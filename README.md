We propose a Novel Deep Learning Architecture for the Image Deraining task, or in simple words, to remove rain from a single image.

The architecture is inspired by a hybrid of these approaches:

Restormer: Efficient Transformer for High-Resolution Image Restoration - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09881.pdf
Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14030
